1. build directories DONT GO in the git repository. Nathing that is produced by compilation goes in the repo!

2. #pragma once is very nice, but not standard. Beware, some compilers may not support it. header guards are ugly, but standard.

3. I could not go into much details, but the code looks nice.

4. If a method is defined in-class, it is inlied by default. You do not need to add the inline specifier 
(but it is not an error if you do)
